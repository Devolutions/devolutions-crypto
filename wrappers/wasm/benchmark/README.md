# WASM benchmark
This is a little project to benchmark the `encrypt` and `decrypt` function. You can find the relevant code under `src/benchmark-service.ts`. 

# Ajust Values
You can find in the code some hardcoded constants, which can help change the parameters used for the benchmark. Simply ajust them according to what you want to test.

# Building and running
