### Testing
#### C#

 - The Xamarin iOS platform is now tested.

## [0.4.0] - 2020-03-15

### Added
#### General
 - Asymmetric encryption. (Rust, C#, JS)
 - Derive key pair from a password. (Rust, C#, JS)
 - Shamir Secret Sharing. (Rust, JS)
 - Official Javascript/Typescript support.

#### C#
 - Documented most functions and enums.
 - The following functions have been added in the ```Utils```. It is not recommended to use them for performance reasons. Keep using ```ValidateSignature(byte[], DataType)``` when possible.
   - ```ValidateSignatureFromBase64```
   - ```ValidateSignatureFromStream```

### Changed
#### C#
 - Renamed functions to be more consistent with what they do. The old functions now have the *[Obsolete]* attribute. 
   - ```StringToByteArray``` is now ```StringToUtf8ByteArray```
   - ```ByteArrayToString``` is now ```ByteArrayToUtf8String```
   - ```Decode``` is now ```DecodeFromBase64```
   - ```Encode``` is now ```EncodeToBase64String```
 - Fixed issue in the ```DeriveKey()``` function
   - Confusion between bits and bytes. The keys generated by the function would be 256 byte instead of 32 byte. The error is now fixed and our decryption will fallback to 256 bytes if the decryption fail.
 - ```DevolutionsCryptoExceptions``` have now more details in the message and the stack trace.

### Breaking Changes
#### C#
 - Renamed the following function
   - ```GenerateKeyExchange``` to ```GenerateKeyPair```
 - Renamed the following class
   - ```KeyExchange``` to ```KeyPair```
 - The function ```DecryptWithKey``` had a ```iterations``` parameter that wasn't used so it has been removed.
 - The function ```DeriveKey``` now returns a key of 32 bytes by default instead of 256 bytes, which couldn't be changed.
      If you already use the method, you can override the default value to 256 and the old data will still work, however it is
      recommended to migrate to 32 bytes key, mostly for performance reasons. 

#### Javascript
The API has completely changed since 0.3 to respect Javascript/Typescript coding styles. Notably, function names has been renamed
to follow the `camelCase` convention and types has been added to prevent key misuse. Also, Typescript declaration has been fixed.

### Testing
#### General
 - Added unit tests for
   - Asymmetric encryption (C#, Rust, JS)
   - Derive key pair from a password. (C#, Rust, JS)
   - Secret Sharing (Rust, JS)
 - Added conformity tests to make sure that old versions are not broken and that all languages are compatible.
   - Key Derivation (C#, Rust, JS)
   - Keypair Derivation (C#, Rust, JS)
   - Symmetric decryption V1 and V2 (C#, Rust, JS)
   - Asymmetric Decryption V2 (C#, Rust, JS)
   - Password Hashin V1 (C#, Rust, JS)

#### C#
 - The Xamarin Mac Full platform is now tested.

#### Javascript/Typescript
 - The Javascript/Typescript API is now tested using NodeJS, instead of only testing the browser features.
 - The tests were not running, this has been fixed.

### CI
#### Code Formatting

The CI now ensures that code pushed to the project is respecting our standards. It also prevent merge conflicts caused by the code formatting.

##### C#
 - Uses SecurityCodeScan and StylecopAnalyzers for code formatting checks.
 - Warnings are now treated as errors.

##### Rust
 - Uses rustfmt and rust-clippy for code formatting checks. 

##### Javascript
 - Tests use eslint for formatting, using [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/)
